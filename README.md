❤️ Heart Mortality Prediction Model
Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart failure using a dataset of clinical records. The model was trained on patient features such as age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow

📌 Key Steps:

Loaded and explored the dataset of 299 patient records

Preprocessed data and split it into training and testing sets

Built and trained a neural network model to classify the risk of death due to heart failure

🧪 Outcome:
A working baseline model to support risk prediction in clinical settings using structured health data.
